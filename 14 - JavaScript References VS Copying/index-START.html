    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let name = 'Bry';
    let name2 = 'Bryan';
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'beewash';
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "Lux";

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(team);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); // creates a new array, not a copy.  Editing teams2 will not effect other arrays
    team2[3] = 'Lux';

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99; // this updates the original person object.  a new object has not been created

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const capt2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 200, age: 50});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
